/// When the Activity is destroyed and recreated (a permission dialog is
/// enough on some devices), re-attaching the process-wide cached engine can
/// silently fail: the launch splash stays on screen forever while the Dart
/// isolate runs on underneath — on a kiosk with the hardware buttons
/// blocked, a dead wall until someone kills the process.
///
/// Detection leans on two ground truths, chosen because everything subtler
/// lies in this state (the native first-frame callback reports "displayed"
/// from the previous attach; Dart frame callbacks keep completing into a
/// surface nobody sees):
///
///  1. The Activity is in front — from native onResume/onPause via the
///     background bridge, not the engine's lifecycle reporting.
///  2. A configured kiosk has no WebView attached — the platform view
///     cannot come up without a working attach, so its prolonged absence
///     is the wedge. Transients (a settings-triggered WebView rebuild) last
///     moments; the watchdog needs three consecutive strikes 5s apart.
///
/// Recovery escalates. First a WebView rebuild in place: the create-raced-
/// attach variant (issue #145 — the platform view was requested before the
/// Activity attached, failed once, and never retries) heals with a fresh
/// widget now that the Activity is up. Then, strikes later, a full process
/// restart through the background bridge: for the failed-re-attach variant
/// a rebuild has been observed to leave the wedge in place, and only a
